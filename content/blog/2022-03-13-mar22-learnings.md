I've been busy with the new job and new city, hence didn't read & write as often as before. Here are the learnings I've collected in February 2022.

## Web3

Been investing in crypto/web3 myself, I spent some time reading up. Mostly about fundamental concepts and wisdom from other early adoptors.

* **Go-to-market in Web3** (cold-start problem/network effect) [future.a16z.com](https://future.a16z.com/go-to-market-in-web3/)
* **Gamefi thru a Vietnamese VC’s eye**: from gaining $4K/week to lost it all [namle207.wordpress.com](https://namle207.wordpress.com/2022/02/11/a-long-recapped-my-first-year-diving-into-gamefi-as-an-everyday-player-and-individual-investor/)
* **(Long read) Bitcoin and Blockchain breakdown** [lukeplant.me.uk](https://lukeplant.me.uk/blog/posts/the-technological-case-against-bitcoin-and-blockchain/)

## Platform Product Management

My team at Grab is also seeking for better product management. It’s quite different because we build product for other development team. The keyword here is “Developer Experience”, or DX. Some of the articles I found interesting:

* **Anatomy of a PM Job Description**: how should YoE, domain knowledge and company stage should be understood [ellenchisa.substack.com](https://ellenchisa.substack.com/p/anatomy-of-a-pm-job-description?s=r)

* **Everyone should read about Ruby on Rails philosophy** [rubyonrails.org/doctrine](https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine)

## Mentors

There’s a lot of ways to find a mentor. I came across a lot of people online and some have the same path as mine. Here is the list of people I will reach out and seek for advice/wisdom:

* **Becoming CTO KyberNetwork** in 4 years, NUS, ACM [linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xuan-manh-le-910343113/)
* **Engineer → CEO, KMS,** Master at Hawaii Uni (2015), [zingnews.vn](https://zingnews.vn/tong-giam-doc-kms-technology-thanh-cong-phai-do-bang-gia-tri-tao-ra-post907051.html)

## Companies

Fascinating companies always have something that we could learn from. List of companies I watch this month:

## Leverages

I name this section as Leverages since one could read and apply it to their case right away. I find these articles short but very practical, that they could be the “leverage” for me or others in some cases.
