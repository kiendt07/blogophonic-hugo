# Books

**[An Elegant Defense](https://www.amazon.com/Elegant-Defense-Extraordinary-Science-Immune-ebook/dp/B07C66KJC1).** Help me understand our **immune system** via stories and facts across the history of immunology.

**The immune system** is one of the most (if not the most) complicated systems in our body, it's the one behind so many deaths and diseases (like cancer, HIV, obesity, etc).

**Written by a journalist** in such a cool and engaging way, so I think everyone can read this book with ease. Grab this book if you want to dive deep into topics of biology or health.
