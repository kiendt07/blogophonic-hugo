**I have to admit something.**

**It's so hard to find a good book** to read these days. Book recommendations are [too vague](https://bookauthority.org/books/best-technology-books) and [irrelevant](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2021/1/10-technology-books-must-read-2021) to me. Finding [great people](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/my-reading-list/) with the same [reading interest](https://lethain.com/tags/book/) to follow is also [hard](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books).

Then something hit me 6 months agowhen I had a catch-up call with an old colleague. By the end of the call, since we were running out of things to talk about, I just ask him: "What do you read recently?".

And then we talked for 30 minutes more. Now I wish I ask that question sooner. And more often.

In that 30 minutes, he recommended me bunch of great books about politics and governments. I also had the chance to talk about my recent favorite books. It's such a productive talk.

After the call, we were just really happy about those new books to check out later.

## The Idea

After that call, I thought it could be a good idea to turn that into something to share with others. Here is what I did:

* Ask people 2 questions: 1/ Who are you and what do you do? 2/ Three books you love recently and why?
* Curate the answers and summarize them into a blog post.
* Attach a form at the end of the post so others can submit their recommendations for the next post :) spreading the good vibe 🤘

I believe this will bring value to you because:

* **It's all about quality.** The books recommended here are all really great books.
* **It's relevant.** With the note from the recommender, you can decide to check out the book or not. It's 100% what they talk to me so it's really personal and genuine :)
* **Spread the good vibe** :) I hope this post can help to connect people with the same reading interests.

Okay, thanks for reading this far. Please find below the recommendations of Harley, Nghia and me. Enjoy!

## **@harley**

### ***Who are you and what do you do?***

I’m Harley, cofounder of CoderPush. I’m a first-time CEO (thank god for Long) who aims to share a modern and international work experience with engineers to grow and wow clients all over the world!

### ***Three books you love recently and why?***

**[Getting Naked](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Naked-Business-Shedding-Sabotage/dp/0787976393)**: *a business fable about shedding the three fears that sabotage client loyalty.* This was gifted to me by our first client last year and it’s an inspiration to love what I do at CoderPush.

**[The Five Dysfunctions of a Team](https://www.amazon.com/Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership-Fable/dp/0787960756)** by the same author as the above, Patrick Lencioni. This pyramid provides a great framework to build a company, culture, and guide ourselves. It’s amazingly simple to remember, hard to master, but this framework points to what’s lacking!

We need to build **trust**. We need to embrace **conflicts** built on mutual trust. Unafraid of conflicts, we can now **commit** to the decisions we make. With commitment, we need to hold one another **accountable**. Without accountability, we don’t pay **attention to results.**

**[The Phenix Project](https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/0988262592).** The book (another fable!) is about a transformation in a company that struggles with inefficient processes and eventually launches a new innovative project. It ties together proven concepts that should be applied in a modern company in many fields: leadership, culture, security, software, and general IT operations. Funnily, the fictional people in this book refers to the Five dysfunctions of a team book too and applied them.

This book (and its sequels by the same authors) also influences me to hold a strong conviction in CI/CD and deploy many times a day instead of by sprint cycles.

### ***Who are you and what do you do?***

TBD. Please send me your answer Nghia!

### ***Three books you love recently and why?***

**[Permanent Record](https://www.amazon.com/Permanent-Record-Edward-Snowden/dp/1250237238)**, a very serious book about privacy written by the famous whistleblower Edward Snowden who leaked highly classified information from the NSA. I love this book and absolutely love Edward Snowden’s selfless character.

This is my favorite of Edward Snowden’s quote: “Arguing that you don’t care about privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don’t care about free speech because you have nothing to say”.

**[Billion Dollar Loser](https://www.amazon.com/Billion-Dollar-Loser-Spectacular-Neumann/dp/0316461369).** This is a fun read about how WeWork, one of the most well-funded startups, **failed because of the leadership (or lack thereof) of its leader.** I like this book because **it’s fun** and also there are not many books written about **entrepreneurship failures**. It’s a good cautionary tale on extreme growth.

**[That Will Never Work](https://www.amazon.com/That-Will-Never-Work-Netflix/dp/0316530204),** one of the **best startup books** I’ve ever read. This book is actually better than the books about Amazon, Uber, Airbnb because it’s written by its founder. I’ve had many questions about how a startup is run and the journey and the pivot it will have to go through to survive and this book does a great job painting a picture in my head.

**The best quote in the book is: “Nobody knows anything”.** Netflix started off with a good idea but was eventually phased out due to how easy it is for big companies to copy and reproduce.

**Through trial and error and a lot of luck,** they came up with the membership/subscription model which has been the norm for e-commerce companies since then. This is not what the founder had envisioned his company to become but everything worked out in the end.

### ***Who are you and what do you do?***

> I’m Kien Do, tech lead of SleekSign squad @ [sleek.com](http://sleek.com/), a CoderPush client based in Singapore. Recently I've been really looking into 1/ how the world really works and 2/ biohacking. You could read some stuff I write about my learnings [here](http://thelifelonglearner.blog/) and [here](https://code.thelifelonglearner.blog/).

### ***Three books you love recently and why?***

**[Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World](https://www.amazon.com/Factfulness-Reasons-World-Things-Better/dp/1250107814).** Excellent book, by a team of three father/son/daughter-in-law statisticians. You will absolutely enjoy this book if 1/ **you like data and numbers**, and 2/ you want to understand **some myths about the modern world.**

The first chapter is the best, explaining **how come the definition of developing/developed countries are already outdated** (it should be divided into 4 categories instead). Other chapters are equally awesome, but Chapter 1 is the most informative for me.

Such a fascinating book. Lots of stories can hit you in your soft spot as well since the author is an **ex-doctor trying to help people around the world during the wars**. I reallyyyyy recommend this book!!!

[**Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World**.](https://www.amazon.com/Range-Generalists-Triumph-Specialized-World/dp/0735214484) I found this one when scrolling through Bill Gates’s book recommendation list, talking about being a **generalist** versus a **specialist** in the modern world.

The book has stories about **Roger Federer** (a generalist) playing various sports up until 16 years old before ended up with tennis and became the best player in the world; or a story about three young Hungarian girls (specialists) who have been raised since the age of 1 **to become the best chess players** in the world.

It’s such a fun book to read, especially if you are curious about how to become the best in your professional life.

**[An Elegant Defense](https://www.amazon.com/Elegant-Defense-Extraordinary-Science-Immune-ebook/dp/B07C66KJC1).** Help me understand our **immune system** via stories and facts across the history of immunology.

**The immune system** is one of the most (if not the most) complicated systems in our body, it's the one behind **so many deaths and diseases** (like cancer, HIV, obesity, etc).

**Written by a journalist** in such a cool and engaging way, so I think everyone can read this book with ease. Grab this book if you want to dive deep into topics of biology or health.

#### **Some honorable mentions**

***Radical Candor***, a famous book about being a leader with honesty but also being direct and tough. ***The Complete Guide To Fasting***, a must-read if you are serious about trying fasting to improve your health.\
