Two months ago I was scrolling through Youtube’s junk and suddenly stumbled upon this video. The title is very intriguing: “[Longevity & Why I now eat One Meal a Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKfR6bAXr-c)”.

> “Is this another Reddit-lookalike-black-hole-explained-in-depth kind of stuff?”

I wondered.

It was a lonely Sunday night, and since I’m a total nerd, I was excited enough to click Play.

**My mind was blown away. How come “eating nothing” is so magical?**

The video is full of biology facts and research results, explaining in a nerdy way about why intermittent fasting is one of the greatest way for weight loss and being healthier.

**I was furious.**

> Is breakfast really a lie? Do I really need just one meal a day and still be healthy? What is ketosis and why it comes with so many health benefits?

I was convinced enough to spend a couple of hours more to research about it. Watching that fasting video makes me really want to know about what’s the science behind it and how I can get started.

## A Failed Dietary Experiment

Before diving deep into fasting, let me tell you about one of my failures experimenting a new diet first.

By the end of 2020 I was so obsessed with *plant-based dieting* (after watching [The Game Changers](https://www.netflix.com/title/81157840) of course) in which it restricts me from consuming any kind of animal or animal-derived foods. I’m only allowed to have fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, oils, whole grains, legumes, and beans; basically foods from plants.

Although I did feel ***light*** and ***springy*** during the whole experiment, even managed to pull off a full marathon 42K by the end of it, I did find myself eating 6 meals a day and still occasionally feel ***hungry*** and ***experienced a large amount of muscle loss***.

The problem with plant-based diet is that:

* **I was spending too much time** on prepping and eating the food
* **Hunger kicks in quite often,** in which I always turns jumpy and day-dreamy.
* **It’s just so damn hard giving up meat** almost entirely. This is the main reason why I gave up on plant-based diet.

> ### **`Yet I’m still on the quest of finding the best diet for life.`**

## Why Fasting?

Before jumping into the experiment, I want to lay down some goals first, in order to see if fasting has what it takes or not.

* **I want to lose fat.** I have to admit I do want to look like Ryan Gosling in The Notebook. I need the quickest way to have those six-pack. This means I have to *burn more fat and also increase my muscle mass.* 10% body fat is my dream goal.
* **I also want to have a simple, sustainable dietary plan**. I don’t have 2 hours a day to cook. I don’t want to count the calories intake or google up the ingredients every time I prep a meal. My dream diet must be a quick and healthy way that also easy to incorporate to my everyday life.

Plant-based has failed me, what about fasting? After a week more of researching, it looks really promising to me.

* **Fat Loss?** Checked. According to this and this, fasting is an effective and science-backed method to lose fat in a short period of time.
* **Easy to Follow?** Checked. Fasting is so simple that it can be explained in just two sentences: Eat nothing. Drink water, tea or coffee.
* **It Works With Any Diet.** Bonus point! This is probably the best feature about fasting.

> ### `It’s not about which foods to eat, it’s about when you should eat them.`

Okay, now I was finally convinced. Let’s go for it!

## How To Fast?

I decided to go with ***16-hour intermittent fasting***, since it’s highly recommended for newbie and fairly simple to incorporate into everyday life.

> **`The daily sixteen-hour fast`**

You could go with *12-hours*, *20-hours*, *36-hours*, the *5:2 diet*, *Alternate-Day*, or even *Extended Fasting* (> 4-days), .etc, your choice. But still I highly recommend you to try out the sixteen-hours first.

The guidelines for Sixteen-hours Intermittent Fasting are:

* **Sixteen-hours of fasting window**, in which I DON’T EAT ANYTHING at all for 16 hours straight, from today’s dinner to tomorrow’s lunch. That simply means skipping breakfast. Saying that if I have dinner at 8PM, then I will not eat at all until lunch at 12PM tomorrow.
* **NO FOOD during the fast.** Only some type of liquids are allowed. This is the WTF part. Sounds too extreme right? What about hunger? What if I passed out during the fast? Is this some kind of starvation? Okay calm down, turned out it’s actually not that extreme. Check out the Q&A section below.
* **Eight-hours of eating window** in which I can eat. Everyday I would have 2–3 meals in total, with lunch (\~12PM) and dinner (\~8PM) as usual. A light snack at 4PM is optional, only if I have a heavy workout session later on (around 5–6PM).
* **Food allowed?** For lunch/dinner, in terms of macro nutritions: lots of fat, medium of protein and ***no carb***. It’s recommended that I need to eat natural, unprocessed foods. Only in the snack meal I then eat a bit of *slow carbohydrate* to charge up the body.
* **Workouts regularly**. Even though muscle loss is not a direct outcome of fasting (according to this and this), you will lose fat faster when you have more muscle. Working out regularly is recommended but not a must, so if you hate working out I guess it will be just fine (but I really doubt it).

## Some Boring Metrics to Observe

Lastly, below are some quantitive and qualitative metrics I would observe during the experiment, to see if it would be considered a success or not.

* **Body weight.** I have a [Xiaomi digital scale](https://www.mi.com/global/mi-body-composition-scale/) at home which is pretty accurate (+-50g). It comes with an app that can track my weight overtime, allows me to see my body weight changes via a line chart.
* **Mental state.** Basically this is going to be how I perform emotionally and cognitively through out the day. Word to describe feelings is the metric here, for example I was feeling *light* and *springy* when following plant-based diet. Same process goes to the fasting experiment.
* **Physical state.** It’s just about % body fat, % lean muscle mass, overall wellness, physical activity performance, etc. The Xiaomi app comes with algorithms to approximately calculate % body fat and % lean muscle, which are useful as supporting metrics for the experiment.

That’s it. I have an execution plan with metrics and goals to observe. 4 weeks to try this experiment out. Let’s go baby!

## Four Weeks Later: The Result![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*RPkuYExIvlzS5ak3UmQ_fw.jpeg)



### Body Weight

* **3kg weight loss**, from \~65kg to \~62kg. I do look skinnier but not significantly.
* **3% fat loss.** This is significant for me. I don’t want to show the before-after pics here, but believe me it looks really significant.
* **Maintain lean muscle mass** (around 52kg). Although I do feel a bit stronger since I lost some weight but I still pretty much keep all the muscle :)

### Physical state

* **Stable energy all day long.** No food coma, no hyperactivity after a meal anymore. I do not feel any drop of energy level, even at 8AM (after 12 consecutive hours of fasting). Energy level stays the same which enables me to achieve more things through out the day.
* **Sleep less.** I found myself waking up one hour earlier in the morning and still feel great.
* **Feeling full longer.** Lunch is the biggest meal for me, and some days I don’t feel hungry until 9–10PM. It’s good to know that I don’t need to strictly follow any fixed schedule, therefore I only eat when feeling hungry, which results in enjoying the food more.
* **Weaker in physical activities.** I did have lower performance in things that require an intensive amount of energy like running or HIIT exercise. This results from removing carb entirely I guess. We can talk about this in *Post-mortem* session below.

### Mental state

* **Less desire to eat.** One thing I noticed is that I don’t feel the crave for food as much. I feel really okay without having any snack or fast food in days.
* **Calm and strong.** I do feel more calm, higher consciously awareness yet mentally stronger. It’s not the same as light-headed but more like waking up in the middle of the jungle, sipping a small cup of coffee seeing the run rises.

# Post-mortem

Although it’s only been a month, benefits from fasting are very clear to me. But to be fair, let’s look at both the positives and negatives here.

## Positives

* **On the right track to meet the dietary goals.** I did lose some significant body fat while maintaining muscle mass, also feeling stronger and more calm. Leaner, healthier yet still having more time and energy? I couldn’t ask for more.
* **Less eating, more doing.** This one brings me joy. As I only need to have 2 meals a day, resulting in caring less about what to eat and spending less time to prep/eat, which can save me up to 1 hour a day. Compares to at least 4 meals/day before, this one is super great.
* **Flexible food choice.** During fasting I can enjoy a big fat steak once again. I can eat fatty stuff without feeling guilty, just need to make sure it’s good fat. The range of the food I can eat is way wider compares to plant-based diet. At the end of the day I live to eat, not eat to live right?

## Negatives

* **Good food is expensive.** It’s also harder to prep.
* **Carb is necessary for endurance sports** (and sex). I do recommend to have a light meal with some carb before a heavy physical activity.
* **No NZT-48 effect** (like Bradley Cooper in Limitless). Since my energy level is pretty much stable through out the day, I do miss the feeling of surging the brain power to 120% after a can of Monster or a piece of cheese cake.
